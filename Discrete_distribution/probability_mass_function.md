## **What is a Probability Mass Function (PMF)?**

* A **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** is a rule that tells us **the probability of each possible value** of a **discrete random variable**.
* In short: PMF says **“What is the chance of each possible outcome?”**

👉 Only used for **discrete random variables** (like number of calls, dice rolls, number of products sold).

---

### **Simple Example**

If you toss a coin:

* Random variable **X** = number of heads.
* Possible values = {0, 1}
* PMF:

  * P(X=0) = 0.5 (no head → tail comes)
  * P(X=1) = 0.5 (head comes)

That’s the **PMF** → assigning probabilities to outcomes.

### **Business Use Case Example**

Let’s take a **restaurant** 🍔.

* Random variable **X** = Number of customers arriving in the next 10 minutes.
* Possible values = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

The restaurant studied past data and found:

* P(X=0) = 0.1 (10% chance no customer comes)
* P(X=1) = 0.2
* P(X=2) = 0.4
* P(X=3) = 0.2
* P(X=4) = 0.1

👉 This table is the **PMF**.

### **Why is this useful in business?**

* The restaurant can plan **staffing**.
* If probability of 2 customers (X=2) is highest (0.4), they prepare for that.
* If probability of 0 is low (0.1), they know it’s unlikely to be empty.
