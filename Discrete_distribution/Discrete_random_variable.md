### **What is a Discrete Random Variable?**

A **random variable** is just a number that comes from a random event.

A **discrete random variable** is a random variable that can only take **specific, countable values** (like 0, 1, 2, 3, …).

* It cannot take decimals or infinite possibilities.
* You can list all possible values.

👉 Think of it as: “How many \_\_\_\_?” questions usually give **discrete random variables**.

### **Simple Examples**

1. **Rolling a dice** 🎲
   Possible outcomes = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
   These are discrete numbers.

2. **Number of children in a family**
   Possible outcomes = {0, 1, 2, 3, …}
   You cannot have 2.5 children.

### **Business Use Case Example**

Let’s take a **business context**:

#### Example: Customer Support Calls ☎️

* A company tracks the number of customer support calls they receive in one hour.
* Possible values = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, …}
* They cannot get **2.7 calls**; only whole numbers.

👉 Here, “Number of calls in an hour” is a **discrete random variable**.

* It helps in staffing decisions.
* If average calls per hour = 20, the manager can decide how many agents are needed.

✅ **Key Idea:**
A **discrete random variable** = “Random numbers we can count.”
Not continuous like height, weight, or revenue (those are **continuous random variables**).
