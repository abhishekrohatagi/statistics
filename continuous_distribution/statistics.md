### **1. What is Statistics?**

Statistics is all about **collecting, analyzing, and summarizing data**.

* **Field of statistics:** The whole practice of studying data.
* **Summary statistic:** A single number that tells you something about your data, like **average sales** or **total customers**.

---

### **2. What Can Statistics Do?**

Statistics helps answer many real-world questions, for example:

* How likely is someone to buy a product?
* Will people buy more if a different payment system is available?
* How many hotel rooms will be occupied?
* How many sizes of jeans should be manufactured to fit 95% of people?
* Which advertisement is more effective? (**A/B testing** can help answer this).

Basically, it **helps make decisions based on data**.

---

### **3. What Can't Statistics Do?**

Statistics **cannot answer every question**, especially when it comes to human opinions or reasons.

* Example: Why is *Game of Thrones* popular? Even if we see violent shows attract viewers, we can’t be 100% sure that violence is the reason.
* Statistics can show **patterns**, but not always **causes**.

---

### **4. Types of Statistics**

There are **two main branches**:

1. **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizes data you have.

   * Example: Asking 4 friends how they commute:

     * 50% drive
     * 25% bus
     * 25% bike

2. **Inferential Statistics:** Uses a sample to **guess about the larger population**.

   * Example: From your 4 friends, estimate what percent of all people drive to work.

### **5. Types of Data**

Data comes in **two main types**:

1. **Numeric (Quantitative) Data:** Numbers you can measure.

   * **Continuous:** Measurable quantities (e.g., speed, height, time)
   * **Discrete:** Countable numbers (e.g., number of pets, packages shipped)

2. **Categorical (Qualitative) Data:** Values that belong to groups.

   * **Nominal:** No order (e.g., marital status, country)
   * **Ordinal:** Has order (e.g., survey rating from 1–5)

---

### **6. Categorical Data as Numbers**

Sometimes categories are represented by numbers:

* Married = 1, Unmarried = 0
* Survey ratings: 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)

⚠️ Important: Even if represented as numbers, they **aren’t truly numeric data**.

---

### **7. Why Data Type Matters**

Knowing the type of data is important because it **decides which statistics and visualizations make sense**:

* **Numeric data:** Mean, scatter plots, histograms
* **Categorical data:** Counts, bar plots

You **cannot mix these up**, e.g., using a scatter plot for marital status doesn’t make sense.
