# üìò Chapter: Modeling Business Success with the Binomial Distribution

## üéØ Business Context

In business, many events have **binary outcomes** ‚Äî success or failure, win or lose, yes or no.
Examples:

* A sales executive winning or losing deals
* A startup securing or failing to secure funding rounds
* A marketing email being opened or ignored

To model such outcomes, we use the **Binomial Distribution** ‚Äî a key tool in data-driven business analytics.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Theoretical Foundation

### üîπ Definition

A **Binomial Distribution** models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.

Mathematically:
[
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
]

Where:

* `n` = number of trials (e.g., deals worked on)
* `k` = number of successes (e.g., deals won)
* `p` = probability of success (win rate)
* `1 - p` = probability of failure

### üîπ Conditions

Binomial distribution applies when:

1. Each trial has **two outcomes** (win/loss)
2. Trials are **independent**
3. Probability of success **remains constant**
4. Number of trials `n` is **fixed**

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Case Study: Amir‚Äôs Weekly Sales Performance

### üß© Business Scenario

Amir, a sales manager, works on **3 deals per week** and has a **30% win rate** (p = 0.3).
We‚Äôll model and simulate his performance using Python.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Step-by-Step Python Implementation

### Step 1: Import Libraries & Set Seed

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import binom

np.random.seed(10)
```

---

### Step 2: Simulate 1 Deal

Simulate a single deal ‚Äî either **won (1)** or **lost (0)**.

```python
print(binom.rvs(n=1, p=0.3, size=1))
```

‚úÖ Output: `[0]` or `[1]`

---

### Step 3: Simulate a Week (3 Deals)

Simulate 3 independent deals Amir works on in one week:

```python
print(binom.rvs(n=3, p=0.3, size=1))
```

‚úÖ Output Example: `[2]` ‚Üí Amir won 2 out of 3 deals this week.

---

### Step 4: Simulate a Year (52 Weeks)

Simulate his weekly performance across 52 weeks:

```python
deals = binom.rvs(n=3, p=0.3, size=52)
print(np.mean(deals))
```

‚úÖ Output: `~0.9` ‚Üí On average, Amir wins **0.9 deals per week**.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Probability Analysis

### (a) Probability of Winning All 3 Deals

[
P(X = 3)
]

```python
prob_3 = binom.pmf(3, n=3, p=0.3)
print(prob_3)
```

‚úÖ Output: `0.027` ‚Üí 2.7% chance of winning all 3 deals.

---

### (b) Probability of Winning 1 or Fewer Deals

[
P(X \le 1)
]

```python
prob_less_than_or_equal_1 = binom.cdf(1, n=3, p=0.3)
print(prob_less_than_or_equal_1)
```

‚úÖ Output: `0.784` ‚Üí 78.4% chance of winning 1 or fewer deals.

---

### (c) Probability of Winning More Than 1 Deal

[
P(X > 1) = 1 - P(X \le 1)
]

```python
prob_greater_than_1 = 1 - prob_less_than_or_equal_1
print(prob_greater_than_1)
```

‚úÖ Output: `0.216` ‚Üí 21.6% chance of winning 2 or 3 deals.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Expected Value (Mean Performance)

Expected number of wins per week:
[
E[X] = n \times p
]

```python
expected_wins_per_week = n * p
print(expected_wins_per_week)
```

‚úÖ Output: `0.9` ‚Üí Amir can expect to win **~1 deal per week** on average.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Business Interpretation

| Metric             | Meaning                | Business Insight                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `E[X] = 0.9`       | Expected wins per week | Amir can expect ~1 deal each week     |
| `P(X = 3) = 0.027` | Probability of 3 wins  | Only 2.7% chance of perfect week      |
| `P(X ‚â§ 1) = 0.784` | Probability of ‚â§1 win  | Most weeks, Amir wins 0‚Äì1 deals       |
| `P(X > 1) = 0.216` | Probability of ‚â•2 wins | 21.6% chance of good performance week |

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic Business Takeaways

1. **Set Realistic Targets:** Based on the data, a target of 1 win per week is reasonable.
2. **Improve Win Rate:** If Amir improves his win rate from 30% ‚Üí 50%, his expected weekly wins rise from 0.9 ‚Üí 1.5.
3. **Team Forecasting:** Sales managers can forecast total team performance by scaling up binomial estimates across multiple salespeople.
4. **Performance Risk Modeling:** Use probabilities to predict best- and worst-case sales outcomes.
