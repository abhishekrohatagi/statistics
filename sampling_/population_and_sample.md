# 📖 **Chapter: Sampling (Statistics)**

---

## 🔹 **1. Key Definitions**

**Population**
→ The *entire group* of elements you want to draw conclusions about.

**Sample**
→ A *subset* taken from the population from which data is actually collected.

## 🔹 **2. Understanding with Examples**

| Scenario                                    | Population                              | Why sampling is needed                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Average weight of a grain of sand in Hawaii | All grains of sand in Hawaii            | Population too large → practically impossible to measure all (considered “infinite”) |
| Strength of rope produced by a machine      | Every rope ever produced by the machine | Not all ropes are available & testing might destroy the rope                         |
| Predicting voting preference in Berlin      | All eligible voters in Berlin           | Too expensive/time-consuming to contact everyone                                     |

## 🔹 **3. Why Do We Sample?**

* **Population too large/infinite** — can’t measure everything.
* **Resource constraints** — time, cost, manpower.
* **Destructive testing** — measuring item may destroy it.
* **Future items not yet produced** — can’t be measured.
* **Sampling is workable** — easier and still useful if sample is *representative*.

## 🔹 **4. Goal of Sampling**

→ To select a **representative sample** so that conclusions drawn from it can be generalized to the **entire population**.
