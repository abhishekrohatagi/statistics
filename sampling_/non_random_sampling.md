# **Non-Random Sampling Techniques**

### **Why Non-Random Sampling?**

* Sometimes **random sampling is not possible** (no complete list of the population).
* Aim: still get a **representative sample**.

---

## **1. Opportunity Sampling**

**Definition:**
Selecting elements that are easiest to access during data collection.

**Examples:**

* Picking grains of sand from beaches in Hawaii.
* Asking people you meet on the street in Berlin.

**Pros:**

* Very quick and simple.
* No sampling frame needed.

**Cons:**

* High risk of **bias**:

  * Only certain beaches visited.
  * Choosing larger grains by accident.
  * Only certain people (brave/available) respond.
* Sample may not represent the whole population.

## **2. Quota Sampling**

**Definition:**
Similar to stratified sampling but **without randomness**.
→ Set quotas (fixed numbers) for groups, then use opportunity sampling until quotas are filled.

**Example:**

* Study of school students (ages 14–18).
* Set quota: e.g., 10 students from each age group.
* Collect until each quota is filled.

**Pros:**

* More representative than simple opportunity sampling.
* Quick, cheap, and easy.
* No sampling frame needed.

**Cons:**

* Bias if quotas don’t match actual population proportions.
* Some groups may be hard or impossible to sample.

## **Key Takeaways**

* **Opportunity Sampling:** Easy, quick, but often biased.
* **Quota Sampling:** More balanced, but depends on correct quotas.
* Both methods are useful when **random sampling is not possible**.
* Always aim for a sample that **represents the population**.
