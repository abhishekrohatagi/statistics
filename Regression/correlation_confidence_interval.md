# üìò Correlation Confidence Intervals ‚Äì Notes

## 1. What is Correlation?

* Correlation = shows how strongly two things are related.
* Example: More study hours ‚Üí higher exam marks.

---

## 2. The Problem

* When we calculate correlation from a sample, it may not equal the **true correlation** in the population.
* Example: We find **r = 0.83**, but the real value in the population might be lower or higher.

---

## 3. Confidence Interval (CI)

* A **confidence interval** gives a **range of values** where the true correlation is likely to be.
* **95% CI** means: we are 95% sure the true correlation lies inside that range.

---

## 4. Example

* Sample correlation (**r**) = 0.83
* Sample size (**n**) = 16
* 95% CI = **0.568 to 0.939**

üëâ Meaning:

* The real correlation is **probably between 0.57 and 0.94**.
* It is **definitely not 0**.
* It is **strong**, but not as strong as 0.99.

## 5. Why Sample Size Matters

* **Small sample** ‚Üí wide interval ‚Üí more uncertainty.
* **Large sample** ‚Üí narrow interval ‚Üí more precise estimate.

---

## 6. Why Confidence Intervals are Important

* Don‚Äôt just report: ‚ÄúCorrelation = 0.83.‚Äù
* Always report: ‚ÄúCorrelation = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.94.‚Äù
* This shows **how sure** you are about the result.
* If someone only gives the correlation but not the CI ‚Üí always ask for it.

---

## 7. Key Takeaway

* **Correlation = strength of relationship in sample.**
* **Confidence Interval = possible range of true correlation in population.**
