## 🔑 Key Idea: Independent Events

* **Independent events** are events that do **not affect each other**.
* Example:

  * Rolling a dice and getting a 6. (Probability = 1/6)
  * Flipping a coin and getting heads. (Probability = 1/2)
  * These two do not influence each other.

So, the probability of **both happening together** = multiply them.
👉 (1/6) × (1/2) = 1/12

## 📖 Formal Definition

Two events A and B are **independent if and only if**:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)
$$

* “If and only if” means:

  * If events are independent → this formula works.
  * If the formula works → the events must be independent.

## 📝 Example from Lecture: Sam

* Probability Sam is late = 20% = 0.2
* Probability it rains = 25% = 0.25
* Probability both (late **and** rain) = 10% = 0.1

Now test independence using the formula:

$$
P(\text{Rain and Late}) \stackrel{?}{=} P(\text{Rain}) \times P(\text{Late})
$$

* LHS = 0.1
* RHS = 0.25 × 0.2 = 0.05

👉 Since **0.1 ≠ 0.05**, they are **not independent**.
This means whether it rains does affect the chance of Sam being late.

## 📌 Key Learnings for Notebook

1. **Independent events** → Events that don’t affect each other.
2. Rule:

   $$
   P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)
   $$
3. Use this rule **only when events are independent**.
4. To check independence: calculate both sides. If equal → independent, if not → dependent.
5. Example:

   * Dice and coin → independent.
   * Rain and Sam being late → not independent.
