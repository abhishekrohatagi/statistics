## **1. Why We Need the Coefficient of Variation**

* Standard deviation (**SD**) measures **absolute spread** (in original units).
* Problem: If two datasets have different magnitudes but the same SD, the interpretation can be misleading.

Example:

* Dataset A: 10, 20, 30 → SD = 10
* Dataset B: 110, 120, 130 → SD = 10
  → Same SD, but:

  * In **A**, 10 is 50% of the mean (20) → very spread out relative to size.
  * In **B**, 10 is \~8% of the mean (120) → barely spread out.

**Conclusion:** We need a measure that shows **spread relative to the size of the data values**.

## **2. Definition of Coefficient of Variation (CV)**

Formula (sample version):

$$
CV = \frac{\text{Sample Standard Deviation}}{\text{Sample Mean}}
$$

* Expresses **SD as a fraction of the mean**.
* Often shown as a **percentage**:

$$
CV\% = \frac{\text{SD}}{\text{Mean}} \times 100
$$

## **3. Interpretation**

* **Higher CV** → more spread relative to mean → more variability/volatility.
* **Lower CV** → less spread relative to mean → more consistency.

Example:

* Dataset A: Mean = 20, SD = 10 → CV = 10 ÷ 20 = 0.5 → **50%**
* Dataset B: Mean = 120, SD = 10 → CV = 10 ÷ 120 ≈ 0.083 → **8%**

## **4. Real-World Example — Cryptocurrency Volatility**

**Bitcoin (BTC):**

* Mean price (2021 sample): ≈ \$46,000
* SD: ≈ \$9,650
* CV = 9,650 ÷ 46,000 ≈ 0.21 → **21%**

**Ethereum (ETH):**

* Mean price: ≈ \$2,830
* SD: ≈ \$1,045
* CV = 1,045 ÷ 2,830 ≈ 0.37 → **37%**

**Interpretation:**

* Even though BTC has a bigger absolute SD, ETH’s CV is higher.
* This means ETH is **more volatile relative to its own average value**.

## **5. How to Calculate in Excel**

1. **Find Mean**: `=AVERAGE(range)`
2. **Find Sample SD**: `=STDEV.S(range)`
3. **Calculate CV**: `=SD / Mean`
4. Format as percentage for easier interpretation.

Example:

```
Bitcoin CV: =STDEV.S(BTC_range) / AVERAGE(BTC_range)
Ethereum CV: =STDEV.S(ETH_range) / AVERAGE(ETH_range)
```

## **6. When to Use CV**

* Comparing **volatility** between datasets with different scales.
* Finance: volatility of stocks, cryptocurrencies, commodities.
* Manufacturing: relative variation in product dimensions.
* Science: comparing variation across measurements with different units/magnitudes.

## **7. Key Points to Remember**

* **SD alone** doesn’t tell you relative variability — you need the mean.
* CV removes the effect of magnitude so you can compare fairly.
* CV is **unitless** (because SD and mean have the same units, which cancel out).
* Higher CV → more variable relative to size.
* Always check that the **mean is not zero** — CV is undefined if mean = 0.

If you want, I can make you a **comparison chart** for SD vs CV with examples so you instantly see why CV gives more insight than SD in some cases. That would make it very visual.
