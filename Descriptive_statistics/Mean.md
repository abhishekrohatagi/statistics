# Descriptive Statistics – Mean (Lecture Notes)

## 1. Introduction
**Descriptive Statistics** is a branch of mathematics that helps summarize and describe data.

**Example:**  
An **average** is a descriptive statistic — it gives a single number to represent a dataset.

---

## 2. Topics Covered in This Chapter
1. Mean (average)
2. Median
3. Mode
4. Range & Interquartile Range (IQR)
5. Standard Deviation & Variance
6. Coefficient of Variation
7. Skew & Kurtosis
8. Correlation

---

## 3. Mean (Average)

**Formula:**
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum{x}}{n}
\]
Where:
- \( \sum{x} \) = sum of all data points
- \( n \) = number of data points

**Example:**  
If you have 7 numbers, add them together and divide by 7.

**Excel Function:**
```excel
=AVERAGE(range)
````

---

## 4. Notation

* **μ (mu)** = population mean (entire dataset)
* **x̄ (x bar)** = sample mean (subset of data)
* **N** = population size
* **n** = sample size

---

## 5. Population vs. Sample

* **Population** = entire group you’re interested in.
  Example: all workers in a factory.
* **Sample** = a smaller group taken from the population.
  Example: 7 randomly chosen workers.

> Most times, we only have a **sample**, not the full population.

## 6. Mean from a Frequency Table

**Example:**

| Age | Frequency |
| --- | --------- |
| 14  | 76        |
| 15  | 121       |

**Steps:**

1. Multiply each value by its frequency: $f \times x$
2. Add up the products → $\Sigma(fx)$
3. Add up all frequencies → $\Sigma f$
4. Mean = $\Sigma(fx) \div \Sigma f$

**Excel Shortcut:**

```excel
=SUMPRODUCT(values, frequencies) / SUM(frequencies)
```

---

## 7. Estimating the Mean from Grouped Data

When data is in ranges (e.g., 5–7 kg, 7–8 kg):

1. Find the **midpoint** for each group:

   * 5–7 → midpoint = 6
   * 7–8 → midpoint = 7.5
2. Assume all data in the group is at the midpoint.
3. Calculate the mean using the same frequency table method.

---

## 8. Warning About Grouped Data

Midpoint method assumes **even spread** of data within a range.
This can be **misleading**.

**Example:**
Rainfall 0–2 mm → Most days might actually be 0 mm.
Using midpoint (1 mm) could **overestimate** the mean.

---

## 9. Key Takeaways

* Mean is simple but can be misleading if:

  * Data is skewed
  * Data grouping is uneven
* Always consider the **context** before using the mean.

**Next Topic:** Median

Do you want me to also **add formula images and diagrams** so your GitHub README looks visually appealing? That would make it stand out a lot more.
